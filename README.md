## 📌 Project Overview

This dashboard analyzes the **prospect-to-enrollment funnel** for an education or service-based organization. It highlights where potential candidates drop off and how quickly they move between stages. By tracking **conversion rates** and **average time-to-contact/engage/enroll**, this solution enables leaders to:

- Identify bottlenecks and sharp drop-off points  
- Evaluate team response times  
- Improve engagement and enrollment strategies
